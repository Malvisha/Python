    "[155, 160, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 300]\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The sum of all heights is 1975. The mean will be 1975 / 10 = 197.5. The outlier (300) significantly influences the mean, making it much higher than the typical height in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in the dataset, which is 180 in this case. The outlier (300) does not affect the median as it is one data point and does not disturb the central value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: There is no mode in this dataset, as each height appears only once. The outlier does not affect the mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum heights. The range is 300 - 155 = 145. The outlier (300) significantly inflates the range compared to the rest of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation: Calculating these measures requires finding the mean first:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean = 1975 / 10 = 197.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance = [(155 - 197.5)^2 + (160 - 197.5)^2 + ... + (300 - 197.5)^2] / 10\n",
    "Variance ≈ 2137.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation = √2137.5 ≈ 46.22\n",
    "\n",
    "The outlier (300) significantly impacts the variance and standard deviation, making them higher than they would be without the outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the outlier with a height of 300 influences the measures of central tendency (mean) and measures of dispersion (range, variance, and standard deviation), causing them to be biased and not fully representative of the majority of the data. This demonstrates how outliers can distort our understanding of the dataset and highlights the importance of identifying and handling outliers appropriately in data analysis.\n",
