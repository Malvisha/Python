    "2.Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four pillars of oops are encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (behavior) that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. It provides data hiding and abstraction by defining access modifiers (public, private, protected) to control the visibility and accessibility of attributes and methods. Encapsulation helps in organizing code, reducing complexity, and improving security and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class inherits the properties (attributes and methods) of another class. It allows the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes, where a derived class (subclass) can inherit and extend the functionality of a base class (superclass). Inheritance promotes code reuse, modularity, and extensibility, as well as supports the concept of \"is-a\" relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same message or method invocation in different ways. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, providing a flexible and interchangeable behavior. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding (redefining a method in a derived class) and method overloading (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). Polymorphism promotes code flexibility, modularity, and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of representing complex real-world entities or concepts in a simplified and more manageable form. It allows us to focus on essential features while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction in OOP involves defining abstract classes and abstract methods that provide a common interface without specifying the implementation. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and serve as blueprints for derived classes. Abstraction helps in reducing complexity, enhancing modularity, and promoting code reusability.\n",
